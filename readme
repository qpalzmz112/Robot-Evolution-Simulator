Ludobots assignment 5:

I laid out a few beams at various heights in the world, and made a 'worm' robot that drops onto the beams.
The fitness function compares the parent's z-coordinate to that of its child - higher z-coordinate is better.
My intent is that the robots get better at staying on top of the beams instead of bouncing off of them as they initially do.
