#Assignment 6: Generate Random 1D Creature Morphologies
To run, clone and run `search.py`. This will generate a single random 'creature'

## What morphologies are possible? 
The kinematic chain consists of 5 to 15 links. Each link has its x, y, and z dimensions chosen randomly between 0.1 and an upper bound. 
The upper bound is chosen randomly between 0.5 and 2. 

Each link has a 50% chance to have a sensor, in which case the link is colored green.
